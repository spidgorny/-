    <h1>Privacy Policy for What's Nearby</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated: January 4, 2026</strong></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What's Nearby (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;the app&quot;) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<h3>Location Data</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPS Coordinates</strong>: The app accesses your device's GPS to determine your current location.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Location data is used solely to find nearby Points of Interest (POI) from Wikipedia.</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Your current location is temporarily stored in the app's memory while the app is running. Location coordinates are NOT transmitted to our servers or any third-party services except Wikipedia's public API.</li>
<li><strong>Background Tracking</strong>: When the app is minimized, location updates continue to monitor if you've moved more than 1km to provide notifications about new nearby POI.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Preferences</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language Selection</strong>: Your preferred language for Wikipedia articles is stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences.</li>
<li><strong>Favorites</strong>: POI that you mark as favorites are stored locally on your device.</li>
<li><strong>Last Viewed Timestamp</strong>: The app stores timestamps of when you last viewed each POI to prevent duplicate notifications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data NOT Collected</h3>
<p>We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
<li>Device identifiers for tracking purposes</li>
